## Generated: 2025-07-13

### Summary
After the monorepo creation, several file paths were not updated and many assets are missing or incorrectly referenced.

## 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING FILES (Referenced by Admin)

### Favicon Files
**Location**: Referenced in `/admin/index.html` but missing from site root:
- ❌ `favicon-new.svg` 
- ❌ `apple-touch-icon.png`
- ❌ `favicon-32.png` 
- ❌ `favicon-16.png`
- ✅ `favicon.ico` (exists)

**Issue**: Admin is looking for these in parent directory (`../favicon-new.svg`) but they don't exist.

### Web App Manifest
**Location**: Referenced in `/index.html`:
- ❌ `manifest.json` 

**Issue**: Main site references `./manifest.json` but file doesn't exist.

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### From Backup Snapshots
- Old snapshots only contained `favicon.ico`
- No evidence of other favicon variants in previous structure
- `manifest.json` was never present in backups

### From Git Repository
- Found empty `assets/favicons/` directory in `/home/ittz/itt-github-repo/apps/web/assets/favicons/`
- This suggests favicon files were planned but never created
- No `manifest.json` found in git repo either

## 🛠️ RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1: Create Missing Favicons
```bash
# Create favicon variants from existing favicon.ico
# Need to generate:
# - favicon-new.svg (SVG version)
# - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
# - favicon-32.png (32x32)
# - favicon-16.png (16x16)
```

### Priority 2: Create Web App Manifest
```bash
# Create manifest.json for PWA functionality
# Should include app name, icons, theme colors, etc.
```

### Priority 3: Fix Admin References
```bash
# Update admin/index.html favicon references to point to correct locations
# Or create the missing favicon files in expected locations
```
